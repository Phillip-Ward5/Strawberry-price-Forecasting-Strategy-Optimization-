# Strawberry-price-Forecasting-Strategy-Optimization
This project develops a seasonal time-series forecasting pipeline to predict monthly strawberry prices and evaluate a buy–freeze–sell strategy under operational constraints. The workflow includes backtesting, residual diagnostics, profit simulation, and risk quantification.
The objective is to forecast 2025 prices using historical data (2020–2024) and determine the optimal months to buy and sell strawberries while accounting for freezing costs, storage costs, and price discounting.
